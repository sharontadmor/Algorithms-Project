# Algorithms on the Map

An algorithms project by Sharon Tadmor,

Created with Python.

With the objective of applying the theory learned in Algorithms course, this project combines two of my favorite things: travel and code.

It implements algorithms on graphs, where the nodes are points of interest (specifically museums) in the city of Tel-Aviv.

## Classes and Modules
### Module: algo_module
Implements algorithms on graphs, using data retreived from the Tel-Aviv municipality API.
### Module: poi_module
Retrieves data from the Tel-Aviv municipality API.

Processing the data into a pandas data frame containing the names of poi (points of interest) and their datum-points.

### Class: Graph
### Class: Node
### algo_main
